##### When working on your data science project, consider the following guidelines as best practices.

### Part One

<details>
  <summary><strong>Proposal Requirements :notebook:</strong></summary>

> 1. Project Name: Title for your project 
> 2. Problem Statement: What are you trying to solve?
> 2. Data science Hypothesis(es)/solutions considering: One or multiple angles to consider solving this problem with data science  
> 3. Data sets to be used: Share the links and files, .csvs, .js, .xlsx, .txt, website URLs
> 4. Data dictionaries to describe the data types you're using: write these out in markdown as tables  
> 5. Potential business cases relative to project: how would this help businesses out to make money or save money or improve accuracy or make better products
> 6. Potential stakeholders who would find this interesting: who would be your ideal customer or client for this?
> 7. Potential places to share your results post project (client, world, website, blog)

**Deliverables:**
> 1. To be pushed to github
> 2. To be submitted as a markdown readme.md file in your project-final repository

### Part Two

  <summary><strong>EDA Guidelines :bar_chart:</strong></summary>

> 1. To create a Jupyter .ipynb notebook for data analysis 
> 2. Import your data or data files and to save as dataframes 
> 3. Examine your data, columns and rows and rename and adjust indexing and encoding as appropriate 
> 4. Clean null and blank values, and consider to drop rows, as well as to manipulate data and adjust data types as appropriate, including dates and time, or setting appropriate indices. Adjusting specific values and replacing strings and characters for the data wrangling process.  
> 5. Explore analysis with graphing and visualizations with matplotlib and seaborn and alternative visualization packages (Plotly, bokeh, altair, vincent)
> 6. Perform additional analysis by creating new columns for calculations, including aggregator functions, counts and groupbys.
> 7. Encode categorical variables with a variety of techniques through logical conditions, mapping, applying, where clauses, dummy variables, and one hot encoding 
> 8. Re-run calculations, including crosstabs or pivots, and new graphs to see results 
> 9. Create correlation matrices, pairplots, scatterplot matrices, and heatmaps to determine which attributes should be features for your models and which attributes should not 
> 10. Identify the response variables(s) that you would want to predict/classify/interpret with data science 
> 11. Perform additional feature engineering as necessary, including Min/Max, Normalizaton, Scaling, and additional Pipeline changes that may be beneficial or helpful when you run machine learning 
> 12. Merge or concatenate datasets if you have not already, based on common keys or unique items for more in-depth analysis 
> 13. Add commenting and markdown throughout the jupyter notebook to explain the interpretation of your results or to comment on code that may not be human readable, and help you recall for you what you are referencing.  
> 14. To create a markdown .md milestone report that shows and explains the results of what you have accomplished to date in this part of your course project. Consider also creating a .pdf or .pptx to display initial results, aha moments, or findings that would be novel or fascinating for your final presentations.
